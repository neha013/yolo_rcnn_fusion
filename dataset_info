%DATASET INFO
The proposed technique has been validated on benchmark ETH, INRIA, and Central pedestrian Crossing Sequence
Dataset. ETH dataset contains data recorded with a resolution
of 640 x 480 and a frame rate of 13-14 fps while the
INRIA dataset is also having original high definition images
along with normalized 64 x 128-pixel format with their corresponding annotation files. The central pedestrian crossing
sequence includes three video frame sequences of resolution
640 x 40 with bounding box annotations present for every
fourth frame.
